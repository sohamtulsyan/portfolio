## 9. Rubber-banding — soft boundaries

At an edge, resist progressively instead of stopping hard. A hard stop reads as "frozen"; continuous resistance reads as "responsive, but there's nothing more here." Apply damping that increases the further past the boundary the user drags.

```js
// The further past the bound, the less the element follows — real things slow before they stop
function rubberband(overshoot, dimension, constant = 0.55) {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```
