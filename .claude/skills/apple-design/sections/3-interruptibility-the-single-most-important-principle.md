## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every animation must be interruptible and redirectable at any moment. A user must be able to grab a moving element mid-flight and reverse it without waiting for the animation to finish. A closing modal the user grabs again should follow the finger — not finish closing first, then reopen.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the* presentation *(current) value, never the target value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start the new animation from there. Starting from the logical/target value causes a visible jump.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven** — they can't be smoothly grabbed and reversed mid-flight. Springs animate from the current value by default, which is exactly what interruption needs.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Replacing one animation with another at a reversal creates a velocity discontinuity, a "brick wall." Spring libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid it. (This is what iOS's *additive animations* do natively; on the web, choose a spring library that re-targets from the current velocity.)
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.
